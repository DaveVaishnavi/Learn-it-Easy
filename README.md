# Idea Development

Using flashcards to learn is one of the most commonly used study methods. The flashcard method enables the students to engage in active recalling and also to create lasting connections. Nearly a week before Syntax Error, I found some flashcards from my room while cleaning my book-shelf. It just struck me that programming can recreate this concept of flashcards and enable us to learn some tough things in a very interesting way. As Syntax Error was approaching, I decided to give these 36 hours of the hackathon to develop a FlashCard App for learning different languages. This app will enable us to learn the basic words of the 4 languages that I have chosen: Sanskrit, French, Spanish, and Mandarin. I could have included a whole lot of more languages but due to time-constraint, I chose only 4 of them.

# Features

As you open it, you will see a screen wherein there will 4 buttons for the 4 languages chosen.

Chose the language you want to learn, suppose you chose Sanskrit. As soon as you click on Sanskrit, a new window will appear. You will have a white flashcard on the screen with a word in Sanskrit and 2 buttons, one with a tick symbol and the other with a cross symbol.

If you know the meaning of the displayed word, click on the tick button. This will delete that particular word from your list to learn as you should not get to see something that you already know again and again and you will be shown the next Sanskrit word. If you press the cross button, you will be shown the English meaning of that word on the other side of the flashcard.

Once you see the meaning, you will have to press the tick button to proceed to the next word. For Mandarin, I have also provided the feature of learning the pronunciation of the word; there is a button which when clicked plays the audio, due to time-constraint and lack of resources, I could not add audio to the other 3 languages.

# Tech-stack
Python with several libraries like tkinter, pandas, playsound and random. I used the internet to find all the words with their meanings

# IDE
PyCharm
